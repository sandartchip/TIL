1. Pixel-wise Comparison
- comparing each pixel in the segmented image with the corresponding pixel in ground truth image.

2. Region-Based Comparision
- Instead of evaluating individual pixels, this method evaluates the segmented regions as a whole.
- Common metrics used for region-based comparision include 
-> Precision and Recall (Precision measures the proportion of correctly segmented pixels out of all the pixels predicted as positive , while recall measures the proportion of 
-> F1 Score : harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a single metric to evaluate segmentatin quality.
