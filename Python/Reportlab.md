- Reportlab은 파이썬 라이브러리 중 가장 보편적이다.

- ReportLab is probably the most common Python library for creating PDFs and it is backed by a company of the same name
- It is very robust albeit a bit complicated for some.
- ReportLab comes with a dual license of sorts. The Python library is open source but the company produces a markup language (RML, an XML-based markup) and an optimized version of the library for faster PDF generation which they sell.
