- Recent advances in sequencing technologies promise ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average
- full-length mRNA or cDNA reads in high throughput
- and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in length.
- Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms.


- Minimap2 is a state-of-the-art sequence alignment tool designed for **aligning DNA or RNA sequences against large reference databases**, such as genomes or transcriptomes.
