- Nanopore sequencing is the passing of a **single molecule** through a nanopore that has an ionic current flowing across it. 

- When the molecule passes through a pore, it disrupts the current across the pore and changes the electrical signal characteristically. 

- During nucleic acid sequencing, these electrical signal changes are decoded using **basecalling algorithms** to **determine the DNA or RNA sequence** in real time.
