- A haplotype is a **group of genes** within an organism that was **inherited together from a single parent.**

- The word "haplotype" is derived from the word "haploid," which describes cells with only one set of chromosomes,
- and from the word "genotype," which refers to the genetic makeup of an organism.

- A haplotype can describe **a pair of genes inherited together from one parent on one chromosome,**
  
- or it can describe **all of the genes on a chromosome that were inherited together from a single parent**.
  
- This group of genes was **inherited together because of genetic linkage**,
- or the phenomenon by which genes that are close to each other on the same chromosome are often inherited together.

- In addition, the term "haplotype" can also refer to the inheritance of a cluster of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
-  which are variations at single positions in the DNA sequence among individuals.
